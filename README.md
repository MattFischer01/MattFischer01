## Welcome! 
My name is **Matt Fischer**. I am interested in exploring how bioinformatics tools can expand our understanding of biological mechanisms. Currently, I am a Master's student at Loyola University Chicago. 

### Research Focus
My thesis explores how incorporating diverse populations can improve protein prediction modeling, allowing improved discovery in Proteome Wide Association Studies (PWAS) across ancestries. Through this work, I am incorporating various machine learning models that model the associations between whole genome sequencing and proteomic data, thereby, understanding which genomic variants alter protein levels given a disease phenotype. 

### Skills
